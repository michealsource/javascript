/*
    =========EXCERISE NUMBER ONE=========
    1. Create a variable called points that starts at 40
    2. Create an if statement that checks if points are greater than 20
    3. If points are greater than 20, subtract 10 from points
    4. Log out the points at the end of the program (this should always log)
    5. Change points to start at 15 and run the program again
*/

/*

  =========EXCERISE NUMBER TWO=========
    1. At the start of the program print out: "--- Animal Checker Program ---"
    2. Create a variable called animal that starts at the value "cat"
    3. Create an if statement that checks if animal is equal to "cat"
    4. If it is equal to "cat", print out "Meow!" to the screen
    5. If it is equal to "dog", print out "Woof!" to the screen
    6. If it is neither "cat" nor "dog", print out "Must be an alien"
    7. At the end of the program print out: "--- Animal check complete ---"
    8. Change animal to different values to make sure it works in all cases
*/

/*
 =========EXCERISE NUMBER THREE=========
    Create a program that starts with a number variable.
    The program will print out whether the variable is
    even or odd to the screen when run.

    Change the variable to test it works in both cases.

    HINT: modulus operator ( % ) is your friend
