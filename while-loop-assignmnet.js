/*
    Create a for loop that will print out all the even numbers
    between 10 and 40.

    Do the same for all odd numbers as well.
*/

// ====SECOND ASSIGNMNET=====//
/*
    1. Create a variable called "loggedIn" that starts off as false.
    2. Create a for loop that loops while "loggedIn" is false.
    3. Each loop, print out: "Incorrect login credentials"
    3. After 3 loop iterations, change "loggedIn" to be true.
    4. After the loops is done print out: "Sucessfully logged in!"

    HINT1: This is more challenging with a for loop
    HINT2: This is not an ideal candidate for a for loop!
    HINT3: You don't have to provide all parts of the for loop construct
*/


//===== THIRD ASSINMENT ======//
/*
    1. Create a for loop that runs from 1-100 
    2. Every 10 loops, print out: Checkpoint! and the loop number
    3. On loop 50 print out ONLY: Half way there!
    4. On the final loop (100) print out ONLY: You made it!
    5. AFTER the loop is done, print out: All, done!

    You should see this printed out when run:
    Checkpoint! 10
    Checkpoint! 20
    Checkpoint! 30
    Checkpoint! 40
    Half way there!
    Checkpoint! 60
    Checkpoint! 70
    Checkpoint! 80
    Checkpoint! 90
    You made it!
    All, done!
